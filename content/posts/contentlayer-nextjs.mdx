excerpt: How to implement Contentlayer with NextJS for a better experience using MDX

I don't write a lot (though is something I want to change), but this site is some kind of playground to try new things. The other day stumbled upon a [list of personal websites of developers and designers](https://github.com/stars/brianlovin/lists/personal-websites) and going through them found some using [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/), it looked interesting, so let's try it!

## What is Contentlayer?

> Contentlayer turns your content into data - making it super easy to import MD(X) and CMS content in your app.



## How to add it to your NextJS site?

The first step is to install the needed libraries:

```bash
yarn add contentlayer next-contentlayer
```

Once the installation is complete, a `contentlayer.config.ts` file needs to be created in the root folder of your project. This is the file where all the content definition and project configuration are done.

In my case I only have one type of content, blog posts coming from MDX files.

<CH.Section>

Use `defineDocumentType` for each type of content type you want Contentlayer to manage. Using the [fields](focus://7:13) property we map [frontmatter](https://mdxjs.com/guides/frontmatter/) fields from the document to object properties you can freely use (and to typescript types!).

```js contentlayer.config.ts
import { defineDocumentType } from 'contentlayer/source-files';

const Post = defineDocumentType(() => ({
	name: 'Post',
	filePathPattern: 'posts/*.mdx',
	bodyType: 'mdx',
	fields: {
		title: { type: 'string', required: true },
		date: { type: 'date', required: true },
		tags: { type: 'list', of: { type: 'string' } },
		image: { type: 'string' },
		excerpt: { type: 'string' },
	},
	computedFields,
}));
```

You see that [computedFields](focus://14) property? 

</CH.Section>

<CH.Section>

This fields can go through some extra process, for example to [get the slug](focus://5:8) from the file name, or to get some extra metadata like [reading time](focus://2,9).

```ts contentlayer.config.ts
import type { ComputedFields } from 'contentlayer/source-files';
import readingTime from 'reading-time';

const computedFields: ComputedFields = {
	slug: {
		type: 'string',
		resolve: (doc) => doc._raw.sourceFileName.replace(/\.mdx$/, ''),
	},
	readingTime: { type: 'json', resolve: (doc) => readingTime(doc.body.raw) },
};
```

</CH.Section>

<CH.Section>

Finally we complete the configuration using `makeSource`. We need to [add the content types](focus://9) defined above and we have the option to set [extra configuration for MDX files, like using remark and rehype plugins](focus://2:4,10:16).

```js contentlayer.config.ts
import { makeSource } from 'contentlayer/source-files';
import slug from 'rehype-slug';
import remarkGfm from 'remark-gfm';
import { rehypeAccessibleEmojis } from 'rehype-accessible-emojis';

const contentLayerConfig = makeSource(async () => {
	return {
		contentDirPath: 'content',
		documentTypes: [Post],
		mdx: {
			remarkPlugins: [remarkGfm],
			rehypePlugins: [
				slug,
				rehypeAccessibleEmojis,
			],
		},
	};
});

export default contentLayerConfig;
```

</CH.Section>

With this we are almost done with the configuration, but since we are using NextJS we can hook up to its build process to autogenerate the content and enable live-reload. To do this we need to add some changes on `next.config.js`. In my case I'm using [next-compose-plugins](https://github.com/cyrilwanner/next-compose-plugins) so it looks like this:

```js next.config.js focus=2,9
const withPlugins = require('next-compose-plugins');
const { withContentlayer } = require('next-contentlayer');

const nextConfig = {
	// extra next config
};

module.exports = withPlugins([
	withContentlayer(),
], nextConfig);

```

## How to use it?

With everything in place, running `yarn dev` (or `yarn build` for production) will trigger Contentlayer build process, which generates several files inside the `node_modules/.contentlayer`folder
