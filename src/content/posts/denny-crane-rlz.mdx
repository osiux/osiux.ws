El viernes vi un episodio de [Boston Legal](http://www.boston-legal.org/) que no había visto, y hubo una parte que me hizo morir de risa, y es esta:

> Denny: Brad. I really couldn’t have fired you by myself.
> Brad: Yes, you could have.
> Denny: Yes, I could have. But sometimes people say things they don’t really mean. Like, “I love you.” Or “You’re fired.” So. I really want you to stay with the firm. While everyone was whining about Bev, you were actually trying to take her out. I admire that. You have very large testicles, my friend.
> Brad: Well. Thank you, Denny, I’m flattered you have that opinion of me.
> Denny: It’s not my opinion. I saw you in the shower at the gym. Good God!

Aun no puedo dejar de reir xDDDD
